In this lab, we built an editable blog forum. I used API calls to populate the blog database and call the data for each of the blog posts. The home page renders a list of all the blogs and allows the user to click on each blog to view it on its own page. The single view page allows you to edit or delete the current blog.

What worked:
* In general, this lab went much more smoothly than last time.
* API calls went surprisingly well
* Blog page looks good and works to minimum specs I believe

What didn't work:
* I had some issues to start the lab with loading my starterpack because I found an issue in the starter after I had already pulled it. Eventually, I had to just transfer the correct starter files manually.
* My deployed version has a bizarre issue where if you reload while on a blog post, the font-awesome line in the HTML sometimes goes away, making the edit and delete buttons not appear correctly.
* I had some issue with editing two content fields at once. I fixed it so that it works on my localhost version but can't really tell if it works in the deployed version.
